# Search Extensions

This package contains a bunch of tools, examples, samples and queries to be used with Unity Search. Most Samples are located in the Samples directory and should be compiled with their respective #ifdef.

The Search Extensions package will work with any versions of Unity between 20.3 and 22.1.
- If you are using 20.3: also install the QuickSearch package.
- If you are using 21.1+ : Search extensions will use the builtin Search framework.

## Dependency Viewer

This package contains a prototype for a Dependency Viewer. More details can be found [here](Documentation~/index.md).

Since the Dependency Viewer UI relies on an experimental Table view mechanism it only works for :
- 20.3: also install the QuickSearch package.
- **21.2**
- Notice that it doesn't work with **21.1**.
