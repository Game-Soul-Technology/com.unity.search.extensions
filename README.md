# Search Extensions

This package contains a bunch of tools, examples, samples and queries to be used with Unity Search. Most Samples are located in the Samples directory and should be compiled with their respective #ifdef.

The Search Extensions package will work with Unity 2020.3 and any other versions higher than 2021.1.
- If you are using 20.3: also install the `com.unity.quicksearch@3.0.0-preview.14` package.
- If you are using 21.1+ : Search extensions will use the builtin Search framework.

## Dependency Viewer
